    "* *insurance* - insurance type (Medicare, Private, Medicaid, Government, Self Pay). *Medicare is an insurance program that primarily serves older people (>65) as well as younger disabled people and dialysis patients.

    "# 2. Basic Pre-Processing\n",
    "There are many different ways in which an ICU mortality prediction task can be formulated. **For this assignment, we advise you to use a static approach and predict whether a patient will die, given the first 24 hours of their stay.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Pre-Processing\n",
    "To help you get started, we have prepared several pre-processing steps:\n",
    "1. Merge the `vitals_labs_mean` and `intervention` tables.\n",
    "2. Split the dataset into training, validation, and test set.\n",
    "3. Forward fill missing values: if a measurement was done at a certain time for a particular patient, this measurement is forward filled in time until a new measurement was taken.\n",
    "4. Remove variables with more than 80% missing values across all hours after forward filling.\n",
    "5. Impute remaining missing values with the mean of the original data for each variable across all hours (before forward filling)\n",
    "6. Add demographics table\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Pre-Processing\n",
    "The current pre-processing procedure is just an example and you are free to adapt or add to it as much as you like. Some ideas:\n",
    "* The number of features is very high. You may consider reducing the number of features e.g., through feature selection or aggregating across hourly measurements.\n",
    "* You need to decide whether you want to include the demographics as features in your machine learning model, or only use them for evaluation.\n",
    "* Some machine learning models, such as logistic regression and support vector machines, can benefit from normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "* To avoid information leakage, any pre-processing steps must be based on the **training data only**. For example, when we compute the mean, this must be computed based on the training data set.\n",
    "* The dataset contains hourly measurements of a set of variables. It is likely more informative to compute the average and standard deviation based on the raw measurements across all hours (i.e., `X.stack()`, as opposed to the imputed dataset.).\n",
    "* The resulting dataset is a multi-index dataframe. When you use this directly in scikit-learn 1.0 or higher, you will get a warning `FutureWarning: Feature names only support names that are all strings. Got feature names with dtypes: ['tuple'].`. This warning can be easily silenced by converting your dataframe into a numpy array before passing it to the model (`numpy.array(X)`) or by flattening the multi-index columns into strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In your report, make sure to motivate all pre-processing steps.**"

    "# 3. Compute SOFA scores\n",
    "The SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score is a tool that is currently used in ICU's to judge the likelihood of mortality.

    "* In theory, the SOFA scores can vary from 0 to 24. The MIMIC Extract dataset does not contain all data needed to compute the SOFA score. In particular, it is missing dosage information of catecholamines. As such, **the SOFA scores computed by `compute_sofa()` should be interpreted as a lower bound of the actual SOFA score!**\n",
    "* In practice, ICU  will likely have requested the measurements whenever they want to compute the SOFA score. In our case, the required measurements may not have always been available. Although we have filled missing values using a reasonable approach, this may reduce the predictive performance of SOFA scores compared to practice."
